Hello there!
It's so very nice to meet you!

Welcome to the world of Pokémon!

My name is Rowan.

However, everyone just calls me
the Pokémon Professor.

Before I go any further, is this
your first adventure?

If you need advice, I'm certainly
capable of giving it.

This world is widely inhabited by
creatures known as Pokémon.

Here, I have a Poké Ball.

Touch the button on the middle of
the Poké Ball, if you'd please.

We humans live alongside Pokémon
as friends.

At times we play together,
and at other times we
work together.

Some people use their Pokémon
to battle and develop
closer bonds with them.

What do I do?

I conduct research so that we may
learn more about Pokémon.

Now, why don't you tell me
a little bit about yourself?

Are you a boy?
Or are you a girl?

All right, so you're a girl?

Tell me, what is your name?

Your name is W?

OK...
So, you're W?

A fine name that is!

Now, this boy here...
I believe he's your friend.

What might his name be?

C, is it?
That's your friend's name?

All right, W, the time
has come.

Your very own tale of grand
adventure is about to unfold.

On your journey, you will meet
countless Pokémon and people.

I'm sure that along the way you will
discover many things, perhaps even
something about yourself.

Now, go on, leap into the world of
Pokémon!

That concludes our special report,
"Search for the Red GYARADOS!”

Brought to you by Jubilife TV on
Nationwide Net!

See you next week, same time,
same channel!

Mom: W!

C came calling for you
a little while ago.

I don't know what it was about, but
he said it was an emergency.

Mom: Oh, yes!
W!

Don't go into the tall grass.
Wild Pokémon might attack you.

It would be OK if you had your own
Pokémon, but you don't, so...

Thud!!

C: What was that about?!

Oh, hey, W!

Hey! I'm going to the lake!
You come too! And be quick about it!

OK, W? I'm fining
you ₽1 million if you're late!

C: Oh, jeez!
Forgot something!

C: ...I'd better take
my Bag and Journal, too...

Oh, hey, W!

We're going to the lake!
I'll be waiting on the road!
It's a ₽10 million fine if you're late!

C: Hey, you saw that news
report that was on TV, right?

You know, "Search for the Red
GYARADOS! The mysterious appearance
of the furious Pokémon in a lake!”

That show got me to thinking.

I'll bet our local lake has a Pokémon
like that in it, too!

So, that's what we're gonna do.
We'll go find a Pokémon like that!

C: All right! To the lake!
Let's find us a red GYARADOS!

C: What's going on...?

Professor, there's nothing out of the
ordinary on the other side, either!

Professor: Hmm...
I may have been mistaken...

Something appears to be different
than it was before, but...

Fine! It's enough that we have
seen the lake.

Lucas, we're leaving.

Lucas: Professor, you've been gone
for four years now.

How are you enjoying being back in
Sinnoh?

Professor: ...Hm.
There is one thing I can say.

There are many rare kinds of Pokémon
in Sinnoh.

The region should serve us very well
in regard to our studies.

Professor: Excuse me.
Let us pass, please.

Lucas: Sorry, folks.

C: What was that about?
Those two...

Huh? W!
Let's go check this out!

...
...

What's that?
Don't go into the tall grass?

No problem, no problem!

We won't be in there long enough
for a wild Pokémon to come out.

It's...
A briefcase?

Those people forgot it here.
What are we supposed to do with it?

We can try to deliver it, but who are
they? I heard them say professor...

Waaah!
Po-Pokémon?!

What's going on?!

Look! These are Poké Balls!
Let's battle using these!

Eh...?
Which one do you want, then?

Whoa!
A wild STARLY came charging!

Go! CHIMCHAR!

CHIMCHAR used
Scratch!

The wild STARLY used
Tackle!

CHIMCHAR used
Scratch!

The wild STARLY fainted!

CHIMCHAR gained
16 Exp. Points!

C: Fwaaah!
Your CHIMCHAR totally rocked!

But my PIPLUP was way tougher
than yours!

...They were other people's
Pokémon, though...

But we had to use them...
They won't mind, will they?

Lucas: Whew! You found the briefcase?

The professor would've gone through
the roof if he knew I forgot it here.

Lucas: Hunh?
Whaaaat?!

Did you guys...
Did you use these Pokémon?!

Oh, man... How am I gonna explain
this to the professor?

...This briefcase is the professor's,
so I'll take it, OK?

C: What was that about?

I don't know what's going on.
W, let's get out of here.

My Pokémon got hurt from that
battle.

If we get attacked by another
Pokémon, we might be in trouble.

C: You go ahead...

...I know we have to go return these
Pokémon. They're not ours.

But I want to spend just a little
more time with this little guy...

C: Hey, it's those people!
Is that old guy staring at us?

Professor: Hmm...

I heard from Lucas that
you used our Pokémon?
Let me see them, please.

Hmm...
CHIMCHAR and PIPLUP...

...

Hmm...

I see...
That's how it is...

Lucas!
I'm going back to my lab!

Lucas: Uh... Yeah, of course!
Professor, wait for me!

You should visit us at our lab later,
I think.

We'll be seeing you!

C: What was all that
craziness about?

I mean, if he was angry, he could've
just yelled at us, or whatever...

And didn't he want their Pokémon
back...?

W...
We should go home, too...

Mom: What's up, dear?

...

Wow.
I can't believe that happened to you.

Am I ever glad that both you and
C are unharmed.

The professor you mentioned is
most likely Professor Rowan of
Sandgem Town.

I've heard that he is well known for
his studies on Pokémon.

I hear he's also quite intimidating...

W, I think you need to
visit him in Sandgem Town.

You need to properly explain why you
had no choice but to use his Pokémon.

Don't worry!
I'm sure he will understand.

Oh, I know!
W, put these on.

W received a pair of
Running Shoes!

Going to Sandgem Town is like an
adventure in itself, right?

With those Running Shoes, you can
get to faraway places much faster.

OK...
Let me read the instructions...

"Press the B Button and dash
about faster than ever before!

"Put on the Running Shoes and
blaze new trails of adventure!”

Well, isn't that just nifty!

Lucas: Hi! I've been waiting for you!
The prof's waiting to see you.

See? This is our Pokémon Research
Lab.

We'll just go ahead and...

Thud!!

C: What the...

Oh, it's you, W!

That old guy... He's not scary so
much as he is totally out there!

Aww, it doesn't matter, W.
I'm out of here. See you later!

Lucas: What was that?!

Your friend always seems to be
in such a rush.

Anyway...
Let's go in.

Professor: ...

Finally, you've come.
W, was it?

Let me see your Pokémon again.

...

Hmm...
I see...

This Pokémon seems to be rather
happy.

All righty then!

I'll give that CHIMCHAR to you as
a gift.

Professor: Now that it's yours, would
you like to give it a nickname?

Professor: Hmm, OK, I see...
And you're happy with that nickname?

Professor: Your friend C
told me what happened at the lake.

I heard you battled very well,
despite it being your first time.

And, from what I can see, there is
a growing bond between you and that
Pokémon, though it is still young.

That's why I would like to entrust
you with CHIMCHAR.

Lucas: Boy, am I glad you're kind
toward Pokémon.

If you weren't, well...
I don't even want to think about it.

Professor: Er-hem!
Let's move on to the main topic.

There is something I want you
to do for me.

My name is Rowan.
I study Pokémon.

First of all, I want to know exactly
what kinds of Pokémon live in the
Sinnoh region.

To do so, it is necessary to collect
data using the Pokédex.

This is what I wish to ask of you.

I want to entrust you with this
Pokédex.

Will you use it to record data on all
the Pokémon in Sinnoh for me?

Rowan: Hm!

Good answer!

W obtained
the Pokédex!

Rowan: That Pokédex is a very
high-tech device.

It will automatically record data on
every kind of Pokémon you encounter.

W, I ask that you go
everywhere and meet every kind of
Pokémon in this region!

Lucas: I've got the same kind of
Pokédex as you.

Rowan: When you walked up Route 201
with your Pokémon, what did you feel?

I've lived for 60 long years.
Even now, I get a thrill when

I'm with a Pokémon.

Now, you should know that there are
countless Pokémon in this world.

That means there are just as many
thrills waiting for you out there!

Now go!

W, your grand adventure
begins right now!

Lucas: The professor asked me to
help, so I'm going to go out and fill
the Pokédex pages, too.

That makes us comrades working
toward the same goal.

I'll teach you stuff later, OK?

Lucas: Hey, W!
I want to show you a few things.
So, follow me!

This building with the red roof is
the Pokémon Center.

You can get your Pokémon healed if
it's been hurt in battle.

You'll find a Pokémon Center in most
towns.

Over here, the building with the blue
roof is the Poké Mart.

It's a shop where you can buy and
sell all sorts of items.

W, since you're a rookie
Trainer, you won't be able to buy
very much stuff.

Don't worry about it, OK?

Oh, yeah, right!
W...

You should let your family know
you're helping Prof. Rowan put
together his Pokédex.

Sometimes, you have to go far away,
so you should let someone know.

Oh, but first, go heal up your
Pokémon at the Poké Center.

You'll be safe then.
OK, be seeing you!

Mom: Welcome home, W.
Are you and your Pokémon healthy?

It's so late right now...
Take a quick rest, dear.

Mom: What's up, W?

...

Wow. Professor Rowan asked you
to do something that big.

OK, dear, go for it!
Your mom's got your back!

Oh, I know! W, I've got
something that you'll find useful.

W obtained
the Journal!

W put the Journal
in the ■KEY ITEMS Pocket.

That's a Journal. It keeps a record
of your daily events.

Check it, and you'll be able to
remember what you did last.

Gee, a journey full of adventure...
I envy you, kiddo.

Plus, you're not alone.
You have your Pokémon with you.
I wish I could go instead!

I'm just joking, dear!
Yup, W!

I'll be all right by myself, so you
go and enjoy your adventure!

When you're exposed to new things,
and experience new sensations...
It makes your mother happy too.

...But come back sometimes.

I would like to see the kinds of
Pokémon you've caught, dear.

C's mom: Excuse me.
Is my little C here?

Mom: Oh?
No, he's not...

C's mom: Oh...
Then, he must have left already...
What to do...

That boy shouted about going on an
adventure, then he bolted.

He's so headstrong and reckless...
I at least wanted him to take this...

Mom: Not to worry, W will
deliver that to him.

Won't you, W?

C's mom: Oh, really?
You'd do that for me?

W, please take this to
C for me.

W obtained
the Parcel!

W put the Parcel
in the ■KEY ITEMS Pocket.

Mom: Bye-bye, W!
Enjoy your adventure!

C's mom: Let me think...

Knowing my boy, he would probably
head straight to Jubilife City...

OK, please take that to my
C.

Lucas: W, do you know
how to catch a Pokémon?

I'll demonstrate how to catch
one, so just watch, OK?

A wild BIDOOF appeared!

Go! TURTWIG!

TURTWIG used
Tackle!

The wild BIDOOF used
Tackle!

All right! I got its HP down!
Time to throw a Poké Ball!

Lucas used
one Poké Ball!

Gotcha!
BIDOOF was caught!

Lucas: And that's how it's done.

Actually, I should have lowered the
target's HP some more.

Yup, the important thing is to lower
the Pokémon's HP as much as possible.

See, a healthy Pokémon isn't easy to
catch.

Oh, yeah. They also get easier to
catch if you make one of your
Pokémon put them to sleep or such.

Here, W, I'll give you
five Poké Balls to get you started.

Obtained the Poké Balls!

W put the Poké Balls
in the ■POKé BALLS Pocket.

If you have lots of Pokémon with you,
you'll be able to travel farther.

That way, you'll have a better shot
at meeting more Pokémon.

See you around!

You're a Pokémon Trainer!
I happen to be a Pokémon Trainer!

Our eyes met, so battle we must!

W found
a Potion!

W put the Potion
in the ■MEDICINE Pocket.

Lucas: Hey, W!
How many Pokémon have you caught?

Huh?
I think you should catch some more.

It ■

It might be more of a challenge
raising a lot of Pokémon...

But it's worth it. The more Pokémon
you have, the happier you'll be.

In Jubilife City, there's the Trainers'
School. Check it out, W.

Oh yeah, C went to the
Trainers' School earlier.

OK, see you around!
Work hard on your Pokédex!

C: Hey, W!
Did you come to study, too?

I went ahead and memorized everything
that was up on the blackboard.

After all, it's the Trainer's job to
avoid having their precious Pokémon
hurt in battle, right?

So, W, what brings you?
You've got something for me?

W delivered the Parcel.

C: So, what is this...?

Score!
It's a Town Map!

Huh?!
Why are there two in here?

I like it a lot, but I don't need two.
Here, W, you take one!

W obtained
the Town Map!

W put the Town Map
in the ■KEY ITEMS Pocket.

C: Hmm...

Well, according to the Town Map,
I guess Oreburgh City is where
I should be going next.

There's a Gym, so it'd be perfect for
raising the Pokémon I just caught.

Well, I'm on the road to becoming
the greatest Trainer of all time!

See you around!

I just became friends with my
Pokémon.

I'm not sure if we can do this
properly, but may we battle?

I need to try the things I learned
before I forget them!

You are challenged by
School Kid Christine!

School Kid Christine sent
out ABRA!

Go! Z!

Z used
Scratch!

A critical hit!

The foe's ABRA fainted!

Z gained

Taunt!

Player defeated
School Kid Christine!

I like to study a lot...
I thought I could win...

W got ₽120
for winning!

Do you think we would have done
better if I used Potions?

Doing it is the best way to learn!
Can we get a battle with you?

Go!
My Pokémon, go!

You are challenged by
School Kid Harrison!

School Kid Harrison sent
out ABRA!

Oh snap!
That's how it is, then?

W got ₽120
for winning!

Whew! You're really good!

We've been studying every day, but
we were no match at all!

You'd be able to use this Technical
Machine properly. Here you go!

Obtained the TM10!

W put the TM10
in the ■TMs HMs Pocket.

A Technical Machine, or TM for short,
contains a Pokémon move.

Using a TM, you can instantly teach
its move to a Pokémon.

But remember--a TM is good for one
use only. Don't waste it!

Z's HP was restored
by 20 point(s).

Booted up a TM.

It contained
Hidden Power.

Teach Hidden Power
to a Pokémon?

Z wants to learn the
move Hidden Power.

However, Z already
knows four moves.

Should a move be deleted and
replaced with Hidden Power?

Which move should be
forgotten?

1, 2, and... ... ... Poof!

Z forgot how to
use Taunt.

And...

Z learned
Hidden Power!

Oh, oh, oh?

You call yourself a Pokémon Trainer?
And yet you have no Pokétch?

That is, Pokémon Watch, or Pokétch
for short!

Oh my, you are a rare case
indeed!

You see, I invented, and now
manufacture, Pokétches.

Not only that, I'm now conducting
the Pokétch promotional campaign!

All you have to do is find three
clowns in Jubilife City.

If you can find them...
I will gift you with a Pokétch!

Hi! I'm a Pokétch campaign clown!
Let's roll out my question!

Does a Pokémon grow by defeating
others and gaining Exp. Points?

Ding-ding!
You're absolutely correct!

Pokémon grow stronger by defeating
other Pokémon in battle.

Some Pokémon even grow into an
entirely different form in a process
known as evolution.

Here you go!
Your Pokétch Coupon!

W obtained
the Coupon 1!

W put the Coupon 1
in the ■KEY ITEMS Pocket.

Hi! I'm a Pokétch campaign clown!
Let's roll out my question!

Just like Pokémon types, the moves
of Pokémon also have types?

Ding-ding!
You're absolutely correct!

If the Pokémon's type matches its
move's type, that move is made much
more powerful!

Here you go!
Your Pokétch Coupon!

W obtained
the Coupon 2!

W put the Coupon 2
in the ■KEY ITEMS Pocket.

Hi! I'm a Pokétch campaign clown!
Let's roll out my question!

Can a Pokémon hold an item?

Ding-ding!
You're absolutely correct!

A Pokémon may hold a single item.

Some items become effective as soon
as they are held by a Pokémon.

Berries are eaten by Pokémon as
necessary during battle.

Here you go!
Your Pokétch Coupon!

W obtained
the Coupon 3!

W put the Coupon 3
in the ■KEY ITEMS Pocket.

OK, let me count your Coupons!
I'll use the Pokétch here...

One, two, three!
Bravo! I say, bravo!

In return for these Coupons,
I present you this Pokémon Watch,
or Pokétch for short!

W received a Pokétch!

You can add apps to your Pokétch
to make it even more versatile!

Touch the Pokétch screen and please
do try it out!

C: Hey! W!
Tell me you got a little tougher!

Me? Do you even need to ask?
Of course I got tougher!

Come on!
Let's battle it out!

You are challenged by
Trainer C!

Trainer C sent
out STARLY!

Go! Z!

The foe's STARLY used
Quick Attack!

Z used
Ember!

Don't get cocky, kid!
This isn't over yet!

Z used
Ember!

The foe's STARLY fainted!

Z gained
84 Exp. Points!

Z grew to
Lv. 10!

Trainer C sent
out PIPLUP!

Z used
Scratch!

The foe's PIPLUP used
Growl!

Z's Attack

Z used

It's super effective!

The foe's PIPLUP fainted!

Z gained
126 Exp. Points!

Z grew to
Lv. 11!

Player defeated
Trainer C!

What just happened?
I lost?!

W got ₽900
for winning!

C: Waah!
What do you mean I lost?!

Well, that's it!
That's the last time I'll ever lose!

I'm going to be the world's toughest
Trainer, and you know it!

The first thing to do is take on
the Oreburgh City Pokémon Gym!

I'm gonna toughen up for that,
totally!

Oh, lookie there!
You've got a Pokétch!

Hmm... You're still a pretty new
Trainer, aren't you?

But it's all good! You're a new
fellow friend of Pokémon!

So, let me make a gift of this
Hidden Machine to you!

Obtained the HM06!

W put the HM06
in the ■TMs HMs Pocket.

That Hidden Machine, or HM for short,
contains the hidden move Rock Smash.

A Pokémon learning Rock Smash can
smash small boulders in the field.

But the Trainer has to have
the Gym Badge from Oreburgh City.

If you don't have that Badge, you
can't make a Pokémon use the hidden
move Rock Smash outside of battle.

Howdy, Trainer!

If you don't have a single Gym Badge,
other Trainers will look down on
you like you're a total noob, right?

So, I'll show you where the town's
Pokémon Gym is.

Huh?
There's someone there.

W found
an Escape Rope!

W put the Escape Rope
in the ■ITEMS Pocket.

OK, stand back and watch this.

Using the hidden move Rock Smash,
a boulder blocking your way...

Fallen boulders need to be smashed
so they're out of the way.

If you could get the Badge from
the Gym in town, you'd be able
to do this too.

Of course, you'd have to beat the
Gym Leader first. That'd be me!

Booted up an HM.

It contained
Rock Smash.

Teach Rock Smash
to a Pokémon?

Z wants to learn the
move Rock Smash.

However, Z already
knows four moves.

Should a move be deleted and
replaced with Rock Smash?

Which move should be
forgotten?

1, 2, and... ... ... Poof!

Z forgot how to
use Scratch.

And...

Z learned
Rock Smash!

Welcome!
This is the Oreburgh Pokémon Gym!

I'm Roark, the Gym Leader!

I'm but one Trainer who decided to
walk proudly with Rock-type Pokémon!

As the Gym Leader, I need to see
your potential as a Trainer.

And, I'll need to see the toughness
of the Pokémon that battle with you!

You are challenged by
Leader Roark!

Leader Roark sent
out GEODUDE!

Go! Z!

Z used
Hidden Power!

It's super effective!

The foe's GEODUDE fainted!

Z gained
187 Exp. Points!

Leader Roark sent
out ONIX!

Z used
Hidden Power!

It's super effective!

The foe's ONIX fainted!

Z gained
277 Exp. Points!

Z grew to
Lv. 12!

Leader Roark sent
out CRANIDOS!

Think you can take down the
next Pokémon like you did earlier?

The foe's CRANIDOS has
Mold Breaker!

Z used
Hidden Power!

It's super effective!

The foe's CRANIDOS used
Headbutt!

No way! Not yet!
Not giving up!

Leader Roark
used one Potion!

Z used
Hidden Power!

It's super effective!

Z used
Hidden Power!

It's super effective!

The foe's CRANIDOS fainted!

Z gained
297 Exp. Points!

Z grew to
Lv. 13!

Player defeated
Leader Roark!

W-what? That can't be!
My buffed-up Pokémon!

W got ₽1680
for winning!

This is embarrassing...

I went and lost to a Trainer who
didn't have a single Gym Badge...

But that's tough. You were strong,
and I was weak. That's all there is.

According to Pokémon League rules,
I have to give you our Gym Badge
since you've beaten me, the Leader.

Here's your official Pokémon League
Coal Badge.

W received
the Coal Badge from Roark!

Having that Coal Badge means your
Pokémon can now use the hidden move
Rock Smash outside of battle.

You should also take this, too.

Obtained the TM76!

W put the TM76
in the ■TMs HMs Pocket.

That TM76 contains
the move Stealth Rock.

It's a move that inflicts damage on
foes that switch into battle.

Incidentally, a TM will teach its move
to a Pokémon instantly.

But a TM will break when you use it,
so make certain you want a Pokémon
to learn that move.

Thud!!

C: Whoops! W!
You got the Gym Badge, huh?

Eterna City is the next place with
a Gym that gives away Badges, right?

So, yeah, I went to Route 207, but
you can't go there without a Bicycle.

I made my team battle and toughened
them up, so it wasn't a waste.

So, I'm going back to Jubilife City.
Next stop, the Eterna Gym Badge!

Ten seconds before I dash!

Nine...

Bah! Who's got time to count?!

Rowan: Ah, W.
Impeccable timing as always.

These miscreants are babbling utter
nonsense that I just can't stomach.

Show them some manners, if you will.

Mystery man: Oh, Professor Pokémon,
must you be so difficult?

We are approaching you strictly
as businessmen.

All you must do is provide us with
all your research findings.

In return, we'll refrain from causing
massive damage to your assistant.

Lucas: W!
Join me and battle these guys!

You are challenged by
Galactic Grunt and
Galactic Grunt!

Galactic Grunt sent
out WURMPLE!

Trainer Lucas sent
out TURTWIG!
Go! Z!

Z used
Ember!

It's super effective!

The foe's WURMPLE fainted!

Z gained
103 Exp. Points!

Z grew to
Lv. 14!

The foe's ZUBAT used
Leech Life!

It's super effective!

TURTWIG had its
energy drained!

TURTWIG used
Tackle!

Z used
Ember!

The foe's ZUBAT fainted!

Z gained
103 Exp. Points!

Player beat
Galactic Grunt
and Galactic Grunt!

How is this madness possible?
The two of us, losing to children?

This won't do... Time to retreat.
This mission is a failure.

W got ₽720
for winning!

What?

Z is evolving!

Congratulations! Your Z
evolved into MONFERNO!

Z wants to learn
the move Mach Punch.

However, Z already
knows four moves.

Should a move be deleted?

1, 2, and... ... Poof!

Z forgot how to
use Hidden Power.

And...

Z learned
Mach Punch!

Grunt: You leave us no option.
We will retreat for now.

Because Team Galactic is benevolent
to all, we shall leave.

Rowan: That lot...
They called themselves Team Galactic.

When Pokémon evolve, they seem to
release some type of energy...

However, I believe that it's a mystic
power far beyond our control.

But Team Galactic seems to be trying
to use that power for something...

Anyway, W, well done!
You battle quite capably.

The sight of you Trainers and Pokémon
battling together...

I made the right decision in
entrusting you with a Pokédex!

Lucas: W, did you know
about this?

The professor studies about the
evolution of Pokémon, too.

According to his research, 90% of
all Pokémon are somehow tied
to evolution!

I guess that means some Pokémon
must undergo weird evolutions.

So, W...
Let's keep working on our Pokédex
project for the prof!

Oh, that was very good!
Nicely done! Truly excellent!

Oh, I beg your pardon, I'm from
Jubilife TV!

I'd like you to have something for
letting me see that smashing battle!

W obtained
the Fashion Case!

W put the Fashion Case
in the ■KEY ITEMS Pocket.

Contained within that Fashion Case...

You will find a whole spectrum of chic
Accessories and tasteful Backdrops!

Dress up your Pokémon and watch
their appeal grow!

And, right now the TV station is
offering its facilities so visitors
can dress up their Pokémon!

There are also prize giveaways, too!
Please do visit our TV station!

This rock appears to be breakable.
Would you like to use Rock Smash?

Z used Rock Smash!

Help, help, Trainer!

Please, can you get my papa for me?
He works at the Valley Windworks.

But the people dressed like spacemen
are mean and won't let me in...

Grunt 1: Enough arguing!
Hand over that sweet Honey!

Grunt 2: Do as we say!
Team Galactic will have that Honey!

We must have it to attract Pokémon
in great numbers!

Grunt 1: Hey! This kid is a witness!
What'll we do?

Grunt 2: We don't need the brat
running off to get help...

The solution's simple!
We ensure the brat stays quiet!

Grunt 1: This brat's tough!
Like, really, really tough!

Tougher than I can put into words,
and I know a lot of words!

We're done for here... Let's get back
to the Valley Windworks.

Oh, what's this thing?
They seem to have forgotten it...

It's a Works Key...
It must be for the Valley Windworks!

It's of no use to me.
You may as well have it.

W obtained
the Works Key!

W put the Works Key
in the ■KEY ITEMS Pocket.

Thank you!
You surely saved me.

Those goons were trying to rob me
of my sweet, sweet Honey.

They sure were weird, though.
You saw how they were dressed.

What they were saying didn't make
a whole lot of sense, either.

Oh! I need to thank you!
Will you take this as my thanks?

Obtained the Honey!

W put the Honey
in the ■ITEMS Pocket.

If you slather that Honey on
a sweet-smelling tree, it might
attract Pokémon.

W found
a Potion!

W put the Potion
in the ■MEDICINE Pocket.

Don't you dare go into the Valley
Windworks.

I got ordered to keep everyone out
if they're not part of Team Galactic.

You're giving me a look that makes
me think you're gonna try to get in.

OK, then.
You'll have to battle me for it!

You are challenged by
Galactic Grunt!

Galactic Grunt sent
out GLAMEOW!

Go! Z!

Z used

It's super effective!

The foe's GLAMEOW fainted!

Z gained
166 Exp. Points!

Player defeated
Galactic Grunt!

Yeah, like I'm really supposed to
win with a Pokémon like this...

W got ₽440
for winning!

Isn't that just great.
Getting owned by some kid.

But you can't do a thing if I lock
myself in with my Works Key!

That's right, the other Works Key's
not here!

My cohorts in the flower patch
have the only other one!

Hahaha! In that sense, I'm no
longer the loser!

Ker-chunk!

Z's HP was restored
by 20 point(s).

It's locked from inside!

Use the Works Key?

Ker-chunk!

The door to Valley Windworks opened!

What?! No way!
You have the key?

Locking the door was meaningless!
I am the loser in this after all!

This is no time for self-pity!
I've got to alert the Commander!

I'm one of Team Galactic's three
Commanders.

We've been trying to create a new
world that's better than this one...

But people have shown little
understanding about what we do.

You don't understand either, do you?
It's a little saddening...

So, let's have a battle to decide
what we should do next.

If I win, you leave.

If you win, we, Team Galactic, will
leave!

Make it forget
another move?

Well, then...

Should this Pokémon give up on
learning this new move?

Z did not learn
Fury Swipes.

Player defeated
Commander Mars!

This can't be?! I lost?!
You...you uppity brat!

W got ₽1280
for winning!

Oops!
I messed that one up!

That's all right, though.
I quite enjoyed our battle.

I guess it's time to say good-bye
and leave for the time being!

Team Galactic...

They were saying they had to gather
Pokémon and energy no matter what.

It was for creating a new universe,
or so they claimed.

Nothing they said made any sort
of sense to me.

I can't tell you how grateful
I am for saving me.

I can finally see my little daughter
again!

Little girl: Papa!

Yuck! Papa, you're stinky!
Go shower now, stinky!

Papa: Oh, sorry! Ahaha!
They had me working nonstop!

Little girl: Thank you, Trainer!
You made those bad people go away!

I think the balloon Pokémon will
come visiting again!

W found
a Repel!

W put the Repel
in the ■ITEMS Pocket.

Hello, my name's Cheryl.
And you are...?

OK, so your name is W.
I'm sincerely glad to meet you.

W, may I ask a big favor
of you?

I want to get through this forest,
but I'm afraid of doing it alone.

I've heard that there is a sinister
group of people called Team Galactic
about.

I think there'd be safety in numbers.
Please, may I go through with you?

W decided to go with
Cheryl!

Cheryl: I'll keep your Pokémon
in perfect health.

What's cool, you might ask? No?
I'll tell you anyway: bug Pokémon!

Cheryl: Oh! There's the exit!
I'm so relieved... We finally got here.

I would've never been able to get
through this by myself.

Thank you so much, W!

Gardenia: At my Gym, no one gets to
battle with the Gym Leader--me--until
they've beaten all the other Trainers.

I'll be waiting for you in the back.

Let's have our battle!

I'm Eterna's Gym Leader, Gardenia,
the Grass-type master!

When I first saw you, I was convinced
you'd find your way to me.

My hunch was right on the money.
You have a winning aura about you.

W got ₽2640
for winning!

I might've said it before, but you're
really tough!

Wasn't it hard for you to raise your
Pokémon to be so good?

I guess that's a measure of how much
you love your Pokémon.

In recognition of that, I proudly
grant you this!

W received
the Forest Badge from Gardenia!

With the Forest Badge, your Pokémon
can use the hidden move Cut outside
of battle.

Now that you have two Gym Badges,
all Pokémon you received in trades
will obey you up to Lv. 30.

I've also got something else.
It's a gift from me!

Obtained the TM86!

W put the TM86
in the ■TMs HMs Pocket.

That TM86 contains
the move Grass Knot.

It's one of my favorite moves.

The heavier the foe, the more
damage this move will cause.

Oh, is that a Pokédex?
You must be helping Professor Rowan?

What's your name?

...

OK, hello, W.
I'll be sure to remember that name!

My name is Cynthia.
I'm a Trainer just like you.

I've been studying Pokémon mythology
lately, just out of curiosity.

Here in Eterna City, there is a
statue of an ancient Pokémon.

According to myth, it was an
extremely powerful Pokémon.

Who knows? You may encounter
something like it while you're
traveling with your Pokédex.

Try using this.
It should help you on your way.

Obtained the HM01!

W put the HM01
in the ■TMs HMs Pocket.

Cynthia: Remember, the hidden move
Cut can be used in the field.

It will let you go places that were
previously inaccessible to you.

That's important for filling up your
Pokédex, right?

Then luck be with you, young Trainer!

Booted up an HM.

It contained
Cut.

Teach Cut
to a Pokémon?

Z wants to learn the
move Cut.

However, Z already
knows four moves.

Should a move be deleted and
replaced with Cut?

Which move should be
forgotten?

1, 2, and... ... ... Poof!

Z forgot how to
use Ember.

And...

Z learned
Cut!

This tree looks like it can be
cut down! Would you like to cut it?

Z used Cut!

Sorry, deary! Team Galactic doesn't
accept children as members!

W got ₽1600
for winning!

Well, aren't you tough...?

It's OK, though. Our official Pokémon-
statue investigation is finished.

Mars has collected energy from
the Valley Windworks.

We're pretty much finished here.
I'll let you in on one little thing.

Our boss is researching the myths
of ancient Pokémon.

With the power of mythical Pokémon,
he will become the ruler of Sinnoh...

I suggest you keep out of Team
Galactic's affairs from now on.

This is your last warning!

I got my CLEFAIRY back, and it's all
thanks to you!

But that Team Galactic...

They said, "Clefairy came from
space. Hand it over!”

Their logic baffles me still.
It's like they are from space!

Anyway, they're gone now.
Thank you very much!

I can't thank you enough right now,
but cruise by my Cycle Shop, OK?

This tree looks like it can be
cut down! Would you like to cut it?

Z used Cut!

I am! I am the first to have gone
underground and dug some tunnels.

You can call me the Underground Man.
Everyone else does.

I'll make a gift of this to you.
You hold up your end of the deal
and put it to good use!

W obtained
the Explorer Kit!

W put the Explorer Kit
in the ■KEY ITEMS Pocket.

My gift to you, the Explorer Kit,
will instantly take you underground!

You need only to use it, and you
will be down in the tunnels!

The Underground is a different world
where you can do this, that,
and the other thing, too!

Let me mentor you into becoming
a full-fledged spelunker!

Will you take on that challenge?

I had hoped to teach a youngster
like you about the many charms of
the underground tunnels...

But I can't force you to accept my
proposal if you're not inclined.

Sigh...
I get so lonely sometimes...

Thanks for rescuing me!
This is something to show my thanks!

It's the latest model Bicycle!
You must take it. I insist!

W obtained
the Bicycle!

W put the Bicycle
in the ■KEY ITEMS Pocket.

It's the latest model, so I'll read
the operating manual to you.

"Press the B Button to shift up
or down.”

In third gear, you can't go all that
fast, but it's easier to control.

In fourth gear, it gets harder to
steer and stop, but it's fast!

Ride your Bike?

W used the
Repel.

Repel's effect wore off...

Would you like to save the game?

Saving a lot of data...
Don't turn off the power.

Rowan: No matter how many times
I come here, I always find myself
standing up straighter than usual.

Cynthia: It's a natural reaction,
Professor.

This room is a legacy to the hopes,
dreams, and struggles of Pokémon
and their Trainers to excel.

Cynthia: W, welcome
to the Hall of Fame.

Your names will be recorded for
posterity here.

What you are leaving are the memories
of your adventure so far.

It's time to record your names.
You and your Pokémon.

Remember, your Pokémon are partners
that grew with you through
many challenging battles.

This machine will make a permanent
record of your achievement.

Saving...
Don't turn off the power.

W saved the game.
