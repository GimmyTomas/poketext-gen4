Yaaaaaaawn...
...

Huh? It's already become so
bright outside!

Sorry to keep you waiting!

Welcome to the world of Pokémon!

My name is Professor Oak.

But everyone calls me the
Pokémon Professor.

Before we go any further, I'd like to
tell you a few things you should
know about this world!

This world is widely inhabited by
creatures known as Pokémon.

We humans live alongside Pokémon
as friends.

At times we play together, and at
other times we work together.

Some people use their Pokémon to
battle and develop closer bonds
with them.

Now, why don't you tell me a little bit
about yourself?

Are you a boy?
Or are you a girl?
Won't you please tell me?

So, you're a girl then?

Please tell me your name.

Your name is I?
