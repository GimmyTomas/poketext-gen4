Yaaaaaaawn...
...

Huh? It's already become so
bright outside!

Sorry to keep you waiting!

Welcome to the world of Pokémon!

My name is Professor Oak.

But everyone calls me the
Pokémon Professor.

Before we go any further, I'd like to
tell you a few things you should
know about this world!

This world is widely inhabited by
creatures known as Pokémon.

We humans live alongside Pokémon
as friends.

At times we play together, and at
other times we work together.

Some people use their Pokémon to
battle and develop closer bonds
with them.

Now, why don't you tell me a little bit
about yourself?

Are you a boy?
Or are you a girl?
Won't you please tell me?

So, you're a girl then?

Please tell me your name.

Your name is I?

I!
Are you ready?

Your very own tale of grand adventure
is about to unfold.

Fun experiences, difficult experiences,
there's so much waiting for you!

Dreams! Adventure!
Let's go to the world of Pokémon!

I'll see you later!

Hi, I!
You're finally awake.
Your friend Ethan was just here.

He was playing hide-and-seek with
his MARILL.

Oh, I almost forgot! Our acquaintance,
Professor Elm, was looking for you.

He said he had a favor to ask of you.

You know where the lab is, right?
It's right next door to us.

By the way, do you have everything
you need to go out?
Here, use this Bag to carry things...

This is your Trainer Card...

Here you can save a record of
your progress...

These are also rather helpful...

Just try touching the buttons, and
you'll know what to do in no time.

Professor Elm: Hi, I!
I've been waiting for you!

Do you know anything about
my research?

As you know, Pokémon are carried
in Poké Balls these days.

But before the Poké Ball was invented,
people used to walk with Pokémon.
Just like your friend Ethan does!

Poké Balls are great because you can
carry many Pokémon.

But walking with Pokémon must have
some advantages.

It could have something to do with how
Pokémon grow or evolve...

So I'm going to give you a Pokémon!

Can you walk beside this Pokémon,
outside of its Poké Ball, to see if this
brings any special feelings or bonds
between Pokémon and people?

The device over there has some Pokémon
you could choose from...

Professor Elm: Oh, hey! I got an email!

Professor Elm: ...
Hm... Uh-huh... OK...

Professor Elm: Hey, listen.
I have this acquaintance that people
call Mr. Pokémon.

He keeps finding weird things and
raving about his discoveries.

Anyway, I just got an email from him
saying that this time it's real.

It's probably another Pokémon Egg,
but we're still so busy with our
Pokémon research...

Wait!
I know!

You can go in our place, right?
Can we count on you?

You can choose one of the Pokémon
over there.

Professor Elm: Touch a Poké Ball to
see what Pokémon is inside!

Professor Elm: You'll take CYNDAQUIL,
the Fire-type Pokémon?

I received CYNDAQUIL
from Professor Elm!

Give a nickname to the CYNDAQUIL
you received?

Is J the nickname
you want to give?

Professor Elm: How do you like walking
with your Pokémon? It's not bad, is it?

You can take it all the way to
Mr. Pokémon's house.

If your Pokémon gets hurt...

You should heal it with this machine.

It's so easy to use.
Just check the PC on my desk!

Professor Elm: Mr. Pokémon goes
everywhere and finds rarities.
His house is past Cherrygrove City.

Go north a little past Cherrygrove.

I'm counting on you, I!

I, I want you to have these
to help you with your task.

Obtained the Potions!

I put the Potions
in the ■MEDICINE Pocket.

Pokémon are weak in the beginning.

Don't hesitate to use a Potion if you
think yours is in danger.

Ethan: I!

So you picked...
a CYNDAQUIL!

That's a cute Pokémon you have!

When you walk with it, it'll become
more friendly.

You should turn around and talk to it
sometimes, too.

Oh, that's right!
Why don't you show it to your mom?
See ya!

Oh! I!
That's a cute Pokémon you have.

Professor Elm must have given it
to you?

Oh, Professor Elm has a task for you,
you say?
What kind of task?

...

I see. That sounds a little difficult.

But when someone makes that kind of
request of you, it must be important!

Oh, that's right!
I completely forgot!

Your Pokégear came back from the
repair shop!

Here you go!

I received
the Pokégear!

The Pokémon Gear...
or Pokégear, as it's often called,
is what every Trainer should have.

Guess what?
You can use the Pokégear to make a
phone call, too.
Do you remember how?

Just power on the Pokégear and
touch the telephone button, OK?

The names of the people you can call
are automatically registered.

Just select one to give him or her
a call.

Wow, I can't believe it's so easy
to make a phone call!

Professor Elm: Wait one second!

I almost completely forgot
about this...
Here, I'll give you my number.

I registered Professor Elm
in the Pokégear!

Professor Elm: I'll call you if
anything comes up.

You're a rookie Trainer, aren't you?
I can tell!

That's OK! Everyone is a rookie
at some point!

If you'd like, I can teach you a
few things.
OK, then! Follow me!

Ohh... I'm sorry.
I forgot that you weren't wearing the
Running Shoes!

I'll try to go as slow as possible, so
try keeping up!

This is a Pokémon Center. They heal
your Pokémon in no time at all.

You'll be relying on them a lot, so
you better learn about them.

This is a Pokémon Mart.
They sell Poké Balls for catching wild
Pokémon and other useful items.

Route 30 is out this way.

Trainers will be battling their
Pokémon there.

If you go a little farther,
you'll see Mr. Pokémon's House.

This is the sea, as you can see.

Some Pokémon are found only in water.

Here...
It's my house!

For your effort keeping up with me,
I'll give you my Running Shoes!
They're still warm!

...
...

Got you, didn't I?
Don't worry, these are brand new!

I received
the Running Shoes from the Guide Gent!

The instructions read,
"Touch the Sprint Button on the
Touch Screen to sprint.”

It also says,
"Hold the B Button down to sprint.”

...Hffp... Hffp...
I made it...

I forgot about one thing.
This is another token from me!

Take it.

The Guide Gent loaded the Map Card
on I's Pokégear!

I's Pokégear
can now show the Town Map!

Select the Pokégear on the
Touch Screen and then select
the Town Map icon.

You'll see the map of the region
you're currently in!

The Pokégear becomes more useful as
you add Cards.

I wish you luck on your journey!

Hey, kiddo!

How in the world can you be so
oblivious to my eye-catching house?
Hold it right there!

When you follow that path up north,
you will see Mr. Pokémon's house.

But before you go, let me finish what
I have to say.

Do you...have any Apricorns?

Apricorn trees bear fruit once a day.

I have one of those trees, too!

Apricorns are really something.
You can make Poké Balls and
other things.

They are quite useful.

I have a feeling this is meant to be,
because I have something for you!

I obtained
the Apricorn Box!

I put the Apricorn Box
in the ■KEY ITEMS Pocket.

With that Apricorn Box, you can carry
so many Apricorns.

You'll be a decent Apricorn collector!

You must be I.

It was I who sent an email
to Professor Elm earlier.

This is what I want Professor Elm
to examine.

I obtained
the Mystery Egg!

I put the Mystery Egg
in the ■KEY ITEMS Pocket.

A friend of mine from Ecruteak gave
it to me.

I bet you can't find this kind of
Egg in Johto.

I thought Professor Elm might be able
to tell what this is.

"He's the best when it comes to the
research of Pokémon evolution.”

That's a quote from the famous
Professor Oak.

You are returning to Professor Elm?

Here. Your Pokémon should have
some rest.

Professor Oak: And with that...

I'm Professor Oak, a Pokémon
researcher!

So you're I!

I was just visiting my friend
Mr. Pokémon.

I heard you were running an errand
for Professor Elm, so I waited here.

Professor Oak: Oh! What's this?
A rare Pokémon!

I see!
You must be helping Professor Elm's
research! I think I understand why
Professor Elm gave you that Pokémon.

You will treat your Pokémon with love
and care, it seems.

Professor Oak: ...Ah!

You seem to be dependable.
How would you like to help me out?

See? This is the latest version of
the Pokédex.

It automatically records data on
Pokémon you've seen or caught.

It's a high-tech encyclopedia!
I'd like you to have it.

I received the Pokédex
from Professor Oak!

Go meet many kinds of Pokémon and
complete that Pokédex!
But I've stayed too long.

I have to get to Goldenrod for my
usual radio show.

I, I have a feeling that
this is not the last time we'll meet...

Let's exchange numbers
just to be on the safe side.

I registered Professor Oak
in the Pokégear!

H-hello? I?

It's a disaster!
Uh, um, it's just terrible!

What should I do?
It... Oh, no...

Please get back here now!

...

You got a Pokémon at the Lab.
What a waste.

That's a Pokémon that's too good for
a wimp like you.

...
Don't you get what I'm saying?

Well, I too have a good Pokémon.
I'll show you what I mean!

You are challenged by
Passerby Boy!

Passerby Boy sent
out TOTODILE!

...Humph!
Are you happy you won?

I got ₽500
for winning!

...

Do you want to know who I am?
...

I'm going to be the world's greatest
Pokémon Trainer.

Give it back!
That's my Trainer Card!

Oh no!
You saw my name...
