Hello there!
It's so very nice to meet you!

Welcome to the world of Pokémon!

My name is Rowan.

However, everyone just calls me
the Pokémon Professor.

Before I go any further, is this
your first adventure?

If you need advice, I'm certainly
capable of giving it.

This world is widely inhabited by
creatures known as Pokémon.

Here, I have a Poké Ball.

Touch the button on the middle of
the Poké Ball, if you'd please.

We humans live alongside Pokémon
as friends.

At times we play together,
and at other times we
work together.

Some people use their Pokémon
to battle and develop
closer bonds with them.

What do I do?

I conduct research so that we may
learn more about Pokémon.

Now, why don't you tell me
a little bit about yourself?

Are you a boy?
Or are you a girl?

All right, so you're a girl?

Tell me, what is your name?

Your name is W?

OK...
So, you're W?

A fine name that is!

Now, this boy here...
I believe he's your friend.

What might his name be?

C, is it?
That's your friend's name?

All right, W, the time
has come.

Your very own tale of grand
adventure is about to unfold.

On your journey, you will meet
countless Pokémon and people.

I'm sure that along the way you will
discover many things, perhaps even
something about yourself.

Now, go on, leap into the world of
Pokémon!

That concludes our special report,
"Search for the Red GYARADOS!”

Brought to you by Jubilife TV on
Nationwide Net!

See you next week, same time,
same channel!

Mom: W!

C came calling for you
a little while ago.

I don't know what it was about, but
he said it was an emergency.

Mom: Oh, yes!
W!

Don't go into the tall grass.
Wild Pokémon might attack you.

It would be OK if you had your own
Pokémon, but you don't, so...

Thud!!

C: What was that about?!

Oh, hey, W!

Hey! I'm going to the lake!
You come too! And be quick about it!

OK, W? I'm fining
you ₽1 million if you're late!

C: Oh, jeez!
Forgot something!

C: ...I'd better take
my Bag and Journal, too...

Oh, hey, W!

We're going to the lake!
I'll be waiting on the road!
It's a ₽10 million fine if you're late!

C: Hey, you saw that news
report that was on TV, right?

You know, "Search for the Red
GYARADOS! The mysterious appearance
of the furious Pokémon in a lake!”

That show got me to thinking.

I'll bet our local lake has a Pokémon
like that in it, too!

So, that's what we're gonna do.
We'll go find a Pokémon like that!

C: All right! To the lake!
Let's find us a red GYARADOS!

C: What's going on...?

Professor, there's nothing out of the
ordinary on the other side, either!

Professor: Hmm...
I may have been mistaken...

Something appears to be different
than it was before, but...

Fine! It's enough that we have
seen the lake.

Lucas, we're leaving.

Lucas: Professor, you've been gone
for four years now.

How are you enjoying being back in
Sinnoh?

Professor: ...Hm.
There is one thing I can say.

There are many rare kinds of Pokémon
in Sinnoh.

The region should serve us very well
in regard to our studies.

Professor: Excuse me.
Let us pass, please.

Lucas: Sorry, folks.

C: What was that about?
Those two...

Huh? W!
Let's go check this out!

...
...
...

What's that?
Don't go into the tall grass?

No problem, no problem!

We won't be in there long enough
for a wild Pokémon to come out.

It's...
A briefcase?

Those people forgot it here.
What are we supposed to do with it?

We can try to deliver it, but who are
they? I heard them say professor...

Waaah!
Po-Pokémon?!

What's going on?!

Look! These are Poké Balls!
Let's battle using these!

Eh...?
Which one do you want, then?

Whoa!
A wild STARLY came charging!

Go! CHIMCHAR!

CHIMCHAR used
Scratch!

The wild STARLY used
Tackle!

CHIMCHAR used
Scratch!

The wild STARLY fainted!

CHIMCHAR gained
16 Exp. Points!

C: Fwaaah!
Your CHIMCHAR totally rocked!

But my PIPLUP was way tougher
than yours!

...They were other people's
Pokémon, though...

But we had to use them...
They won't mind, will they?
