Hello there!
It's so very nice to meet you!

Welcome to the world of Pokémon!

My name is Rowan.

However, everyone just calls me
the Pokémon Professor.

Before I go any further, is this
your first adventure?

If you need advice, I'm certainly
capable of giving it.

This world is widely inhabited by
creatures known as Pokémon.

Here, I have a Poké Ball.

Touch the button on the middle of
the Poké Ball, if you'd please.

We humans live alongside Pokémon
as friends.

At times we play together,
and at other times we
work together.

Some people use their Pokémon
to battle and develop
closer bonds with them.

What do I do?

I conduct research so that we may
learn more about Pokémon.

Now, why don't you tell me
a little bit about yourself?

Are you a boy?
Or are you a girl?

All right, so you're a girl?

Tell me, what is your name?

Your name is W?

OK...
So, you're W?

A fine name that is!

Now, this boy here...
I believe he's your friend.

What might his name be?

C, is it?
That's your friend's name?

All right, W, the time
has come.

Your very own tale of grand
adventure is about to unfold.

On your journey, you will meet
countless Pokémon and people.

I'm sure that along the way you will
discover many things, perhaps even
something about yourself.

Now, go on, leap into the world of
Pokémon!

That concludes our special report,
"Search for the Red GYARADOS!”

See you next week, same time,
same channel!

Mom: W!

C came calling for you
a little while ago.

I don't know what it was about, but
he said it was an emergency.

Mom: Oh, yes!
W!

Don't go into the tall grass.
Wild Pokémon might attack you.

It would be OK if you had your own
Pokémon, but you don't, so...

Thud!!

C: What was that about?!

Oh, hey, W!

Hey! I'm going to the lake!
You come too! And be quick about it!

OK, W? I'm fining
you ₽1 million if you're late!

C: Oh, jeez!
Forgot something!

C: ...I'd better take
my Bag and Journal, too...

Oh, hey, W!

We're going to the lake!
I'll be waiting on the road!
It's a ₽10 million fine if you're late!
